> Playground for experimenting with some of the core features of [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io) and integration with other software and services.

This setup is using:
* [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org) - programming lang
* [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) - the ES6 module loader used by [JSPM](http://jspm.io)
* [Angular 2](http://angular.io/)
* [Core JS](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) - necessary for browsers that haven't implemented any or some of the [ES6](http://es6-features.org) features used by Angular 2 and this project

Hosting:
* [Firebase](https://firebase.com) - realtime store for the app's data, authentication and hosting provider

Unit/E2E tests:
* [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor) - e2e test framework
* [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io) - test runner for the app unit tests
* [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io) - assertion lib

CI/CD:
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) - used as both continuous integration and delivery service for the app
* [Saucelabs](https://saucelabs.com) - browser provider for running the app tests on the CI server

Tools:
* [BrowserSync](http://browsersync.io) - used as a static webserver for local development
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) - task runner

Package/Typings manager:
* [Gemnasium](https://gemnasium.com) - keeps an eye on all the project dependencies version's
* [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings)
* [NPM](https://npmjs.com)
* [JSPM](http://jspm.io)

UI:
* [Angular 2 Material](https://github.com/angular/material2)

### Setup
---------
Make sure you have [Node](http://nodejs.org) (*if not already installed*) then clone this repo and setup the following tools on your machine using `npm install -g <package>`:
* [JSPM](http://jspm.io)
* [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings)
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

**Note**: All the above tools are only necessary to install globally to avoid writing `./node_modules/.bin/<command>`/`$(npm bin)/<command>` every time you want to run a command. Users running OS X or Linux based systems (soon Windows as well) could also use tools like [direnv](http://direnv.net) to expose the local npm binaries using a `.envrc` file:
```shell
# Node Binaries
export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/node_modules/.bin
```

After you have installed the above tools, install all runtime/dev dependencies by running:

```shell
$(node bin)/npm install
$(npm bin)/typings install
$(npm bin)/jspm install
```

**Note**: If you change any of the deps (remove/add) in either `package.json` or `typings.json`, make sure that you run the above commands again.

Now start the webserver and the app will open in your default browser:

```shell
$(node bin)/npm start # `$(npm bin)/gulp serve`
```


### Firebase
------------
#### Hosting

If you want to use your own Firebase account for [hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart), then you have to do a few things in order to make it work.

First make sure that you have ran `$(node bin)/npm install` so that the [firebase-tools](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools) dependency is installed. Run the following command to get an auth token (follow the steps you are given by the command):

```shell
$(npm bin)/firebase login:ci
```

Copy the token and put it somewhere safe for further usage.

Also change the `"default": "firebase-ng2-lab"` property from `.firebaserc` to the name of you Firebase app.

Now you can deploy the app to you own Firebase by running:

```shell
$(npm bin)/gulp deploy --token <your firebase token>
```

**Note**: If you use tools like [direnv](http://direnv.net/) you can export a `FIREBASE_TOKEN` which will be picked up by the `$(npm bin)/gulp deploy` so you won't need to provide the `--token` option every time you run the command.

Also, you need to build the app using `$(npm bin)/gulp build` before any deployments if there were changes to the code and it has not been build yet.


### Travis CI
-------------
If you plan on using this setup with your own projects and you wish to setup Travis CI, then you must make sure of a couple of things in order to have everything working properly on the CI:

1. Setup and env variable `FIREBASE_TOKEN` containing the token you got from `$(npm bin)/firebase login:ci` so that your deployments to firebase will work. If you do not use Firebase, skip this step. You may want to encrypt the token if the source code is public, use the Travis [docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Encrypted-Variables) to see how to do it.
2. In case you use SauceLabs, set the env var `SAUCE_USERNAME` to your own username and create a new env variable `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` containing the access key you can get from the SauceLabs dashboard (read more about setting up SauceLabs with Travis [here](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/sauce-connect/)).
3. If you do not use the deployment to Firebase, remove that step from `.travis.yml`.

Now, keep in mind that cloning this repo and continuing in the same project will give you some issues with Travis if you setup your own account. So I suggest you start out with a clean project and start git from scratch (`git init`), then copy over things from this project (obviously, do not include `.git` - not visible on most UNIX base systems).


### Development
---------------
Below you can find a few of things to help understand how this setup works and how to make it easier when developing on this app (or starting your own and use this as a guideline).

#### Info

During development, when running the app in the browser, all TS is being compiled offline. To get started use `$(npm bin)/gulp serve` which will start a static webserver and rerun builds on file changes.

Unit tests run the same way, so there is no need to rerun builds when a spec or source file is changed. For further info about unit tests read below.

E2E tests specs need no compilation as you will be writing them in ES6.

#### Running Tests

Tests can be run selectively as it follows:

* `$(npm bin)/gulp lint`: runs [tslint](http://palantir.github.io/tslint/) and checks all `.ts` files according to the `tslint.json` rules file
* `$(npm bin)/gulp test/unit:continuous`: unit tests in a browser; runs in watch mode (i.e. watches the source files for changes and re-runs tests when files are updated)
* `$(npm bin)/gulp test/unit:single`: unit tests in a browser; runs in single run mode, meaning it will run once and it will not watch for file changes
* `$(npm bin)/gulp test/e2e:local`: e2e tests in a browser; runs in single run mode

And if you have a Saucelabs account, you can also run unit tests on some of the SL browsers provided in `browsers.config.js`. Just call `$(npm bin)/gulp test/unit:sauce --browsers=Chrome, Firefox, iOS9` (and whatever other browsers you wish) and make sure that you have the `SAUCE_USERNAME` and `SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY` env variables set. You can also pass the two env variables as options if you prefer it: `$(npm bin)/gulp test/unit:sauce --browsers=Chrome, Firefox --username=<your sauce username> --acessKey=<you sauce access key>`.

#### Other Tasks

If you just want to build everything, run `$(npm bin)/gulp build`.

And if you want to deploy the app to Firebase (security rules and app files), use `$(npm bin)/gulp deploy`. Just make sure you provide the auth token either as an env variable (`FIREBASE_TOKEN`) or as an option (`--token`).

And of course to see what other tasks are available, run `$(npm bin)/gulp --tasks`.

### Browser Support
-------------------
You can expect the app to run wherever Angular 2 does (see table below).
